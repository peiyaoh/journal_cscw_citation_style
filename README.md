# journal_cscw_citation_style
This is an unofficial version of the citation style (csl) for the [Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): The Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices](hhttp://www.springer.com/computer/journal/10606). I created this to be used with the reference manager, [Zotero] (https://www.zotero.org/). The style is adapted from the [Springer Humanities (author-date)](https://www.zotero.org/styles/springer-humanities-author-date) listed on the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). The original citation style is created by Sebastian Karcher and contributed by [Julian Onions](maito:julian.onions@gmail.com), [Richard Karnesky](http://arc.nucapt.northwestern.edu/Richard_Karnesky), and [Charles Parnot](http://twitter.com/cparnot).  Note: This citation style (csl) is a working verion without being fully tested. I created it in a short time and only used it for citing conference proceedings, journal articles, book chapters, and web pages.
